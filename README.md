#  Big Data Challenge




### Instructions

Using the `home_sales_revised.csv` data in the starter code, I generated a Spark DataFrame, and made a variety of queries described below, demonstrating the ability to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached, among other strategies.


Using SparkSQL, I determined:

    * What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? 

    * What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms?
    * What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet? 

    * What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000? 

Runtime for all queries was recorded and compared between strategies.
